# UAP Detection Project

## Overview

The UAP Detection Project is an end-to-end deep learning solution for detecting Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) in Mars rover imagery. The project leverages state-of-the-art object detection methods, synthetic data generation, and advanced model deployment techniques. The aim is to create a system that not only trains on authentic Mars images but also utilizes a synthetic UAP generator to inject realistic anomalies into the data. This approach enhances the training set and helps the model generalize better, potentially discovering previously unseen UAP-like artifacts in the images.

The project is divided into three major components:
1. **Training Pipeline:** Includes data acquisition, preprocessing, synthetic UAP injection, and model training using a sleek YOLOv5-based architecture.
2. **Evaluation & Metrics:** Provides scripts for evaluating model performance with metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), IoU, and precision-recall curves.
3. **Deployment & Inference:** Involves exporting the model to ONNX, running inference on new data, and serving the model via a Flask-based API for real-time predictions.

This repository serves as both a research tool and a practical solution for anomaly detection on Mars imagery. The modular design allows you to work on different sections independently while maintaining a cohesive workflow.

## Requirements

- **Hardware:** NVIDIA GPU (e.g., GeForce RTX 4080 with 64GB RAM) for training and inference.
- **Operating System:** Linux/Ubuntu recommended for Docker; Windows is supported via Docker Desktop.
- **Software:** Docker, Python 3.8+.
- **Key Python Libraries:**  
  - PyTorch and Torchvision  
  - OpenCV (opencv-python-headless)  
  - ONNX and ONNX Runtime  
  - Flask  
  - NumPy, Matplotlib, Pillow  
  - Other dependencies as specified in the Dockerfile.

## Installation

### Local Setup (Without Docker)
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UAP_Detection_Project.git
   cd UAP_Detection_Project
   ```
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file, otherwise see Dockerfile for dependency list
   ```

### Docker Setup

1. **Ensure Docker is Installed:**  
   Install Docker Desktop if not already installed, and make sure you have NVIDIA Docker support enabled if using a GPU.

2. **Place the Dockerfile in `E:\projects\UAP`.**

3. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   cd E:\projects\UAP
   docker build -t uap_project .
   ```

## Usage

### Training

1. **Run the Training Script:**  
   From within the Docker container or your local environment, navigate to the training directory and execute:
   ```bash
   cd src/train
   python3 train.py
   ```
   This script uses `config.py`, `dataset.py`, `model.py`, and `utils.py` to train the UAP detection model. Checkpoints and logs will be saved in the designated directories.

### Evaluation

1. **Run the Evaluation Script:**  
   After training, evaluate the model performance:
   ```bash
   cd src/Eval
   python3 evaluate.py
   ```
   This script loads the best model checkpoint and computes evaluation metrics such as mAP and loss, providing feedback on the model's performance.

### Model Export

1. **Export the Trained Model:**  
   Convert the trained model to ONNX format for optimized inference:
   ```bash
   cd src/deploy
   python3 export_model.py
   ```
   This will create an ONNX model file (e.g., `uap_detection.onnx`) in the deployment directory.

### Inference

1. **Run the Inference Script:**  
   To test the model on a single image:
   ```bash
   cd src/deploy
   python3 inference.py
   ```
   Ensure that you have a test image in your data folder as specified in the script.

### Server Deployment

1. **Start the Inference Server:**  
   To run a Flask-based API for real-time predictions:
   ```bash
   cd src/deploy
   python3 server.py
   ```
   The server will listen on port 5000. You can then send POST requests to the `/predict` endpoint with an image file to receive detection results.

## Docker Usage: Step-by-Step

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   cd E:\projects\UAP
   docker build -t uap_project .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container Interactively:**
   ```bash
   docker run --gpus all -it -p 5000:5000 -v E:\projects\UAP\data:/app/data uap_project /bin/bash
   ```
   This opens an interactive shell in the container.

3. **Inside the Container, Run the Following Commands Sequentially:**
   - **Train the Model:**
     ```bash
     cd src/train
     python3 train.py
     ```
   - **Evaluate the Model:**
     ```bash
     cd ../Eval
     python3 evaluate.py
     ```
   - **Export the Model:**
     ```bash
     cd ../deploy
     python3 export_model.py
     ```
   - **Run Inference on a Test Image:**
     ```bash
     python3 inference.py
     ```
   - **Start the Flask Server for Real-Time Inference:**
     ```bash
     python3 server.py
     ```
4. **Test the Inference API:**  
   Use cURL, Postman, or a web browser to send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/predict` with an image file.
