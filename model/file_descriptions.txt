model training pipeline

config.py: Holds hyperparameters and configuration settings.

dataset.py: Contains data loading, augmentation, and preprocessing routines.

model.py: Defines the detection model architecture (e.g., classification/ROI network).

train.py: Implements the main training loop, including training, validation, and checkpointing.

utils.py: Provides helper functions for logging, visualization, and model saving/loading.

Evaluation and Metrics section

evaluate.py: Handles running the model on the test/validation dataset and generating predictions.

metrics.py: Contains functions to compute evaluation metrics (mAP, recall, precision, IoU, etc.).

visualize.py: Provides utilities for plotting detection results and visualizing bounding boxes on images.

deployment and inference

export_model.py: Converts the trained model (e.g., to ONNX or TensorRT format).

inference.py: Loads the converted model and runs inference on new images.

server.py: (Optional) Hosts an API or web service for real-time inference.

deploy_utils.py: Contains helper functions for deployment tasks (e.g., image preprocessing, postprocessing of outputs).
